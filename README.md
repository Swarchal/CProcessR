CProcessR
============

:warning: am biologist, no idea what I'm doing -- Package still under development.

- Package for the semi-automated processing of CellProfiler data in R. Aim to to get raw CellProfiler output into a simple useable dataframe. No effort should be made to write code for analysis or visualisation of the data - this is just for processing!

- Functions should work with both .csv files and databases.
